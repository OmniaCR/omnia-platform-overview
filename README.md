## The Story Behind OmniaCR

OmniaCR was created to address a growing challenge in mental health practice: managing large volumes of patient information while detecting subtle patterns across multiple dimensions.

While clinicians bring extensive expertise, synthesizing complex data can be time-consuming and cognitively demanding. OmniaCR was built to assist clinicians by organizing information, highlighting relevant patterns, and suggesting potential hypotheses — always leaving final decisions in the hands of the professional.

From its inception, OmniaCR has focused on improving clarity, efficiency, and quality of care while maintaining a strong human-centered therapeutic approach.
